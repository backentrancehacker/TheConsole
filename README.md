# TheConsole
A completely useless garbage console that you can drag around

## Features
* Simple design
* Close button
* Drag and Drop

## Methods
`console.log`: logs a white message to the console
`console.success`: logs a green message to the console
`console.info`: logs a blue message to the console
`console.warn` and `console.error`: logs a red message to the console
All errors are automatically caught and passed to `console.warn`.

## "Usage"
Since all console methods are overrided, you can use `console.log` just as normal.
